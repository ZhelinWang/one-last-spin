# GenericPreventDecreasesFilterAbility
# Effect:
# - Filters incoming steps on the source token and cancels decreases based on toggles:
#   - block_negative_add: cancels "add" steps with amount < 0.
#   - block_mult_below_one: cancels "mult" steps with factor < 1.0.
# - Applies only to self (the stepâ€™s target_token must equal source_token).
#
# Usage:
# - Attach to a token and set the toggles you want to enforce.
# - Works for both per-token steps and winner broadcast steps, since the executor calls filter_step per target.
#
# Notes:
# - Returning null cancels a step; returning the original (or mutated) Dictionary keeps it.
# - To protect allies too, relax or remove the self-check (target_token != source_token).
# - You can clamp instead of cancel by mutating the step (e.g., set factor = 1.0) and returning it.
